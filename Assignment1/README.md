# Feature Subset selection algorithms

This assignment explores two types of feature selection algorithms:
* Sequential Forward Search
* Hill Climbing 

A feature subset selection algorithm's aim is to search the state space (or feature subset space) for the minimal subset of features that give the best possible performance according to some **evaluation criteria**. This is useful in cases where there are redundant or dependent features that can be removed without any loss of information. 

Here we have used the MSE score of simple linear regression to score the feature subsets. The imput is any standard CSV file, whose name must be specified in the scripts **part1.py** and **part2.py**
